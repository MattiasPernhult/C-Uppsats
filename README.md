# Bachelor thesis

### Information

This is a bachelor thesis written by [Me](https://github.com/MattiasPernhult) and [Felix Alhbin](https://github.com/alhbin) in Swedish.

In this thesis we examine the pros and cons using assessment systems in programming courses at universities.

The problem relevance is based on the increased number of students in such courses and how it makes these almost impossible to conduct without some automated tool or tools.

### How to build

* clone the repo
* open the **uppsatsen.tex** in a LaTeX client
* then build it with the pdflatex compiler

... or just open the file **uppsatsen.pdf**. Observe that this pdf may not be in sync with the LaTeX file.


## LEAP

As a part of this thesis we also implemented a system, LEarning and Assessment of Programming (LEAP).

The source code for LEAP is not open-source yet but we plan, in the near future, to open-source it.
